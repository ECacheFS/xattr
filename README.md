xattr
=====
Extended attribute support for Go (linux + darwin + freebsd).

Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated permanently with files and directories, similar to the environment strings associated with a process. An attribute may be defined or undefined. If it is defined, its value may be empty or non-empty.
